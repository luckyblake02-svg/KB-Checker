<#
You will need the following to start
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph and import
Install-Module ConnectWiseControlAPI and import
Install-Module MsrcSecurityUpdates and import
This script will ask the user for the month/year MSRC catalog they wish to look at, then connect via MSRC API and grab the list of vulnerabilities. The user will then be promped for the specific CVE ID.
Then, the remediations for Windows 11 devices will be grabbed for that specific CVE.
Then, connect to MS Graph, then download a list of all devices that have synced within the last 15 days to Intune. It will then map their OS version to a 4-character code.
Then set the indicated patch for the remediation. Finally, it will connect to ConnectWise Screenconnect, run 'Get-Hotfix' to list all applied patches, and check if any patched match the specified patch for the OS.
Patched devices get stored in $KBList, other devices get stored in $KBNotList.
